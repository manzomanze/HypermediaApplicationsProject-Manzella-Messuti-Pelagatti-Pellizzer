**Contributions**
Davide Manzella: initial setup of the github repository and project, mostly focused on the database.
The E-R schema, the database input injection and the api for the retrieval of information from the database

Umberto Messuti: I have coded the template in HTML, CSS and JavaScript from which we have built the website. I have contributed to the implementation of most of the Vue components used in the website and I have also contributed to implement the connection between the front-end and the back-end. 

Mariano Pelagatti:

Massimiliano Pellizzer: I drew most of the diagrams in the documentation (C-IDM large, C-IDM small, P-IDM, Wireframes), but I have also contributed to the implementation of Vue components and pages. I have reviewed and commented the code.

**Server and DB technologies used**
The choice of the backend's server and db was quite straghtforward following what was seen in the lectures, a simple server to implement the database connection and respective apis in node.js using express module.
The database chosen was the postgresql DBMS that is managed through an ORM called sequelize that is a nod.js module
